Concept
Our model learns the behavior of normal network traffic patterns from the CICIDS dataset using an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm.
When a new network record is added — even if it has never been seen before — the model analyzes its similarity to known normal patterns.
It outputs whether it’s likely an attack or normal, along with a confidence percentage indicating how certain the prediction is


You’re building a Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a hybrid model trained on both NSL-KDD and CICIDS-2017 datasets.

The model uses a combination of signature-based and anomaly-based detection (Isolation Forest for anomaly detection).

The backend is powered by Flask, and the frontend is a dashboard (HTML, CSS, JS) for user input and displaying predictions.


📘 Detailed Project Description

In today’s digital world, organizations rely heavily on computer networks to share and access data. However, these networks are constantly threatened by cyber-attacks such as port scans, denial of service (DoS), brute force, and other malicious intrusions. Detecting these attacks in real time is critical to maintaining data integrity, availability, and security.
To address this issue, our project implements a Network-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDPS) that uses Machine Learning, specifically the Isolation Forest algorithm, to automatically detect and prevent suspicious network activities.

🧩 1. Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project is to monitor network traffic, identify malicious patterns, and prevent possible intrusions using intelligent anomaly detection techniques.
Unlike traditional signature-based IDS systems (which detect only known attacks), our approach uses an unsupervised learning model that can detect unknown or zero-day attacks by identifying abnormal behaviors in network data.

⚙️ 2. Working Process

The system follows these main stages:

a) Data Collection

We used the CICIDS2017 dataset, a widely recognized cybersecurity dataset that simulates real-world network traffic including both normal and malicious activities.
Specifically, we used the file “Friday Working Hours – Afternoon – PortScan”, which contains network flow records with around 286,467 rows and multiple features describing each connection.

b) Feature Selection and Preprocessing

From the dataset, we selected 10 most relevant features that influence intrusion detection, such as:
1.	protocol_type (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
2.	flag (connection status)
3.	destination_port
4.	flow_duration
5.	total_forward_packets
6.	total_backward_packets
7.	total_length_forward_packets
8.	total_length_backward_packets
9.	flow_bytes_per_second
10.	flow_packets_per_second

c) Model Training – Isolation Forest

The Isolation Forest algorithm is used to train the model in an unsupervised way, meaning it does not require labeled attack data.
It works by:

Randomly selecting a feature and split value to isolate data points.
Anomalies (like port scanning behavior) are isolated faster than normal traffic since their characteristics differ from typical network patterns.
Thus, the model learns to separate normal and abnormal network flows automatically.

d) Detection Phase

When new or unseen network data is tested:
The model predicts each record as:
1 → Normal Traffic
-1 → Anomaly (Probing/Attack)
Detected anomalies correspond to probing attempts, meaning someone is trying to scan or identify open ports.

Q. Why Isolation Forest for Probing Detection

We chose Isolation Forest because it is:
⦁	Unsupervised: detects unknown scanning behavior without labeled data.
⦁	Efficient: handles large, high-dimensional datasets like CICIDS2017 quickly.
⦁	Accurate for anomalies: isolates rare, abnormal behaviors (e.g., high packet bursts, fast port sweeps).
⦁	Lightweight: suitable for real-time detection without heavy computational cost.
⦁	By focusing on the probing stage, Isolation Forest can identify attackers before they perform actual intrusions — making it a proactive defense system.


📊 4. Evaluation and Results

The model was evaluated on the PortScan dataset using metrics such as:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Results showed high accuracy in distinguishing normal vs. probing (port scan) traffic, confirming that the Isolation Forest can effectively detect reconnaissance activities.

6. Outcome

The system successfully detects probing attacks in network traffic and can help network administrators act before a real attack occurs.
It provides a base model for proactive intrusion prevention, which can later be integrated with live monitoring and automated blocking mechanisms.
